### Town Square

This is a supporting repository of the Nomad Protocol.  Its purpose is to show the interoperability between games by rendering the sword NFT inside the inventory when the item is transferred from **The Lost Kingdom** through the Nomad smart contracts. It is currently not a playable demo. 

### Running the App

To run this app simply install the depedencies and run `npm run local`.

**NOTE**: This app redirects to the main Nomad UI if you are not signed into your Universal Profile locally.
